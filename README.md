# UFP
The Ultimate Fight Predictor- A fun way to predict the outcome of UFC fights.

### Warning(For now)
The current models were trained on scikit-learn 1.20 so predicting on later versions might not work due to pickle.

### Use 
Enter fighter data in the way specified by <code>./data/example.csv</code> and run main.py with the data you have as a command line argument and predict as the action. 

## Data for training
The model was trained on the [Ultimate UFC Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset?select=ufc-master.csv). If you want to train your own model with the ground work please download the data first.
